            If you are using constructors to make your objects it is best to define
            functions on the prototype of that object

            Doing so means that a single instance of each function will be shared between
            all of the Student objects.
            If we declare the function directly in the constructor like we did when
            they were first introduced that function would be duplicated every time
            a new Student is created.

            In this example, that wouldn't really matter much,
            but in a project that is creatin thousands of objects, it really can make a difference.

        function Student(name) {
            this.name = name
            this.grade = grade
        }

        Student.prototype.sayName = function() {
            console.log(this.name)
        }

        Student.prototype.goToProm = function() {
            // eh.. go to prom?
        }


        // Recommended Method for Prototypical Inheritance

        // At this point in history, the recommended way of setting the prototype
        // of an object is Object.create()
        // It very simply returns a new object with the specified prototype and any
        // additional properties you want to add.

        // don't do this!!!

        function NinthGrader(name) {
          this.name = name
          this.grade = 9
        }

        NinthGrader.prototype.sayName = function() {console.log("HAHAHAHAHAHA")}

        carl.sayName() // carl
        carl.grade // 8
