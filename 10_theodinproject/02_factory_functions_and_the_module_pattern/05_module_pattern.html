        /*
            ES6 introduced a new feature in JavaScript called 'modules'
            These are essentially a syntax for importing and exporting code between
            different JavaScript files.

            Modules are actually very similar to Factory functions
            The main difference is how they're created

            The concepts are exactly the same as the factory function, however,
            instead of creating a factory we can use over and over again to
            create multiple object
            The Module pattern wraps the factory in IIFE( Immediately Invoked Function Expression )

        const calculator = (() => {
            const add = (a, b) => a + b;
            const sub = (a, b) => a - b;
            const mul = (a, b) => a * b;
            const div = (a, b) => a / b;

            return {
                add,
                sub,
                mul,
                div,
            };
        })();

        console.log(calculator.add(3,5));
        console.log(calculator.sub(6,2));
        console.log(calculator.mul(14,5534));
